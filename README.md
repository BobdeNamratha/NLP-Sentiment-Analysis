# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
 Sentiment analysis of US airline tweets involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiments expressed in tweets about US airlines. This analysis aims to understand the overall sentiment, whether positive, negative, or neutral, towards various airlines based on the content of tweets.
 # Key Steps:
 **1. Data Collection:** Tweets mentioning different US airlines are collected from social media platforms like Twitter.

**2. Preprocessing:** The collected tweets undergo preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters to normalize the text.

**3. Sentiment Labeling:** Each tweet is labeled with a sentiment category, typically 'positive,' 'negative,' or 'neutral,' based on the expressed sentiment towards the airline in the tweet.

**4. Feature Extraction:** Features are extracted from the preprocessed text data. Common methods include bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

**5. Model Training:** Machine learning or deep learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests are trained on the labeled tweet data to learn the sentiment patterns.

**6. Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in predicting sentiment.

**7. Analysis and Visualization:** The sentiment analysis results are analyzed to gain insights into customer opinions, trends, and issues related to different US airlines. 

This sentiment analysis offers valuable insights for airlines to improve customer satisfaction and services, and for customers to make informed decisions based on peer feedback.
